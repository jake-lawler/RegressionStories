I'm reading through *Regression and Other Stories* with two goals in mind:

* try to improve my conceptual understanding of regression
* improve my coding of base Stan.

I don't plan on using this notebook to make chapter summaries like I have with other textbooks. Instead I'm just going to use it to practice writing models in Stan, and will make my chapter notes elsewhere. The idea is that I'll need to improve my Stan skills as the models in the book get more complicated. I may use this notebook for end-of-chapter exercises also, we'll see.

I have had some previous exposure to base Stan in [my work-through of Statistical Rethinking](https://jake-lawler.github.io/rethinking/), so I'm not starting completely from scratch. However, I am looking forward to particularly the early portions of this book where I'll hopefully be familiar with a lot of the material and can just focus on applying it using the Stan language.

Alongside the book itself, the other text I'm going to be reading a lot of is the [Stan User Guide](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_29/stan-users-guide/index.html) and some of the other Stan [documentation](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/). That last link includes the reference manuals, but also some example case studies and tutorials which I imagine will be helpful.
